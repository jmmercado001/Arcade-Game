## Summary
Sato's Rush is a twist and clone to the classic Frogger game. As in Frogger Sato now attempts to rush across a busy road. This is project three of my Udacity Front-End Web Development course.

## Game Download
To play Sato's Rush you must first download the Github zip file. Once the file is downloaded you select and open the index.HTML file.

## How to Play
Using the arrow keys you can navigate Sato and by the speeding bugs. The arrows will allow you to move back and forth or side to side to avoid those creepy bugs, but your goal is to make it across the road to the water. Every time Sato gets safetly across the road you earn 50 points and Sato starts back at the beginning.
